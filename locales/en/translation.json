  "Tracking_Fingerprinting_Description": "Browser fingerprinting is a technology that websites use to collect information about your browser type and version, as well as your operating system, active plug-ins, time zone, language, screen resolution and various other active settings. The information is usually assimilated into a brief identifier using a fingerprinting algorithm. Fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual users or devices even when cookies are turned off, the client IP address is hidden, or one switches to another browser on the same device. This may allow a site owner to detect and prevent identity theft and credit card fraud, but also to compile long-term records of your browsing history and deliver targeted advertising or targeted exploits.",
  "Tracking_Social": "Social",
  "Tracking_Social_Description": "Some sites may embed social plug-ins, such as a Facebook “Like” button.
